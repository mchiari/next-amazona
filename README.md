This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Study project!

This is a study project made by me to try to understand tha basics of fullstack development engineering. It's a simple clone of Amazon, where the user can register, log-in, browse through goods, add items to cart, place orders, make payments (currently working only with paypal) and check status of orders. 

## Why?

Although I am a front end developer, I saw the need to better understand some aspects of our work team daily jobs, so I can be a little more prepared to help them if needed or to code backend simple solutions.

## Technologies used in this project:

> Javascript

> React

> Next.js
